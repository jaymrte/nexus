# Nexus-Focus
a website that allows you to focus onto your work and block out distractions.

this website idea is a work in progress, it isnt done but this is my outlne of it. This is my first break in to frontend development, using what ive learned for around the past couple of months. 

The future idea is, ill comeback to this project and continue to work on it and eventually move the code onto its own proper website, im sure i can do it now but i am not the best with CSS.

ive used VS code and cursor to make this application, cursor to give me an outline, then i take it to VS code to run theough the code, add and change things as i see fit, and work wuth the foundation it gave me.
